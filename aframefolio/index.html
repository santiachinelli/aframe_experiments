      <p> I made these during the 2021 Christmas/NYE Holidays in Boonsboro, MD. </p>
         
      <p>The first <a href="projects/wwwm/wwwm.html">project</a> is just my own noodling and doodling with a video I already had handy, and trying to see how I could manipulate the environment. </p>

      <p> The second <a href="projects/wasteland/wasteland.html">project</a> is really just a playpen for testing out different portalling techniques, as well as the interesting embedded audio tools in A-Frame. </p>

      <p> The third <a href="projects/gallery/gallery.html">project</a> is a pretty basic gallery template incorporating what I've learned so far. I plan on cleaning it up further and iterating a few different default template to service the two real world applications I might need them for.  

      <p> My goal was to learn more about WebXR (previously known as WebVR and WebAR) as well as enough D3.js to make interesting visualizations. This cleaved nicely into a project I'm starting with a friend after the holidays to improve access to Town Hall resources in a small New England city (i.e. virtual tour of Town Hall building with interactive components for knowing where to go for what). </p>

      <p> The second possible application I 'found along the way' so to speak. A cozy gallery space in a local private library is likely to close to the public soon due to covid restrictions. Since I know it's going to be photography heavy exhibit, I wanted to design a good template for iterating different 'showings' onto. Maybe even so that we can save the showing for posterity?
   
      
     <p> Super fun, these tiny, holiday hackathons are a great way to turn loafing-downtime into a new skillset.   </p>
